# Welcome to the SignalF project
SignalF is a configurable, modular .NET measurement and control software specially designed for operation on single-board computers such as the Raspberry Pi or the Orange Pi.
In industry, single-board computers are primarily used in measurement and control technology (MCR), where they often replace the much more expensive programmable logic controllers (PLCs).

SignalF is a soft real-time system. The sensor data is read in, the control algorithms and calculators are executed and the control values are output to the actuator at defined time intervals using configurable tasks. When creating your measurement and control software, you no longer have to worry about the architecture of the application, but can concentrate entirely on connecting the hardware and implementing your algorithms.

## Getting Started
The [SignalF documentation](https://signalfdocumentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/getting-started.html#) will guide you through setting up the code and running it on your own system.

## Bug Reports
If you find any bugs, please report them using the (GitHub issue tracker)[]. A test-case that demonstrates the issue is usually required. Instructions on providing a test-case can be found in contributing guidelines or here.

## Contribute
TODO: Explain how other users and developers can contribute to make your code better.
